# jelly.css
Very simple, light and easy to use responsive grid. Feel free to download and edit!

Jelly is my little personal project. I use it in my websites, as alternative for grid from Bootstrap or another frameworks. Jelly is very simple and intuitive. Weighs only 3kb but it's fully responsive and customisable grid for websites.

# How to install jelly

Download jelly.css or jelly.min.css and add it to your project as a usual css stylesheet.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/min/jelly.min.css" />
or
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/min/jelly.css" />
